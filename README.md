<b> GCD and LCM Calculator in Assembly Language </b> <br>
This project is an implementation of a Greatest Common Divisor <i>(GCD)</i> and Least Common Multiple <i>(LCM)</i> calculator using x86 assembly language. It provides a user-friendly console interface to input two numbers and computes their GCD and LCM, handling edge cases such as invalid inputs, zeros, and undefined operations.

<b> Key Features</b> 
User Prompts: Clear prompts to enter two integers.<br>
Edge Case Handling: Special messages for invalid inputs, undefined operations, and "Not a Number" (NaN) cases.
Efficient Algorithm: Uses iterative and arithmetic methods for GCD and LCM calculation.
Dynamic Display: Outputs results in multiple formats, including valid results and error messages.
Interactive UI: Implements text-based output and cursor movement using low-level system calls.
